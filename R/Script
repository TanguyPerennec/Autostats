Survival_uni;Univariate analyses of survival were carried out by the Kaplanâ€“Meier method, and the evaluation of differences was performed with the log-rank test.
Survival_PFS;Data from patients who where alive and free of recurrence or who died without having had a recurrence were censored in the analyses of disease-free survival and recurrence.
Survival_cox;The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals. Cumulative incidence was determined according to the method proposed by Breslow and Day. Statistical comparisons of cumulative incidence rates were performed with the use of a Poisson regression model, with the assigned treatment group (according to the intention to treat) as a cat- egorical covariate. A two-sided P value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to indicate statisti- cal significance. No interim analyses of efficacy end points were performed.
