Variable selection for the final multivariate model has been made iterativly using the
METHOD
from the
null model / complete model
to the final model.
The variable associated to the largest p-value of the likelihood ratio tests of previous model vs the new model
WITH
the variable.
Likelihood ratio test to compare model has been prefered to Wald test and score test due to several coefficient testing simultaneously in categorical variables.
