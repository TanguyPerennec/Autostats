\usage{
reglog(
  DF,
  y,
  explicatives = colnames(DF)[colnames(DF) != y],
  keep = FALSE,
  alpha = 0.05,
  verbose = TRUE,
  min_multivariate = 2,
  alpha_max = 0.2,
  round = 3,
  method = "backward",
  rowstimevariable = 10,
  confirmation = TRUE,
  exit = c("console", "excel")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DF}{dataframe, matrix or tibble that contains all explicatives variables and the variable to explain.}

\item{y}{character : variable to explain.}

\item{explicatives}{character vector : variables that should explain y in the logistic regression. Takes all columns but y from the dataframe if kept empty.}

\item{keep}{character or vector of character (optional) : variables that will be kept in the model no matter of the criteria. Every variable known in the litterature to have interaction with y or other 'keep' variable should be listed in 'keep'.}

\item{alpha}{num : significance threeshold used to delete non-significant variables in the multivariate model.}

\item{verbose}{logical : if TRUE, explainations are displayed in the console while running the function.}

\item{min_multivariate}{num : the minimum number of variables that should be kept in the multivariate model. If the number of significant variables using alpha threeshold is under min_multivariate, alpha is increased by 0.02 points till alpha_max is reached.}

\item{alpha_max}{num : maximum threeshold used to select the minimum multivariate variables wanted.}

\item{round}{num : number of digits to display in the final table.}

\item{method}{the method to be used to select variables in the multivariate model.The default method is the backward elimination. See details for more informations.}

\item{rowstimevariable}{: minimum number of times row has to be bigger than variables}

\item{confirmation}{logical : ask confirmation before doing a transformation}

\item{exit}{character or character vector specifying the exit of the fonction : results in the console or saved in excel file}
}
\value{
reglog returns a matrix with all OR obtain from univariate model and OR obtain from the multivariate model
}
\description{
reglog is used to make logistic regression and gives one matrix with variables, odds-ratios, confidence intervals and p-values of univariate and multivariate models.
}
\details{
Method used to select the variables in the multivariate model can be set it the "method" parameter.
"backward" elimination is the default technique : the least significant effect that does not meet the
level "alpha" for staying in the model is removed. The process is repeated until no other effect in the
model meets the specified level for removal. In "forward" selection, the p-value is computed for each effect
not in the model and examines the largest of these statistics. If it is significant at entry level "alpha",
the corresponding effect is added to the model.Once an effect is entered in the model, it is never removed
from the model. The process is repeated until none of the remaining effects meet the specified level for entry.
